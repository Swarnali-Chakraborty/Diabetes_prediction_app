# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic based on medical diagnostic data using machine learning. It includes multiple models, feature importance analysis, and an interactive Streamlit web app.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle
- **Features**: 
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  - Age
- **Target**: Outcome (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Not Diabetic)

## 🧠 Models Trained

- 🧩 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 🌲 Random Forest
- 📊 Logistic Regression
- 👥 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🔍 Feature Importance

Random Forest was used to calculate feature importance and visualize which medical features contributed most to the prediction.

## 🌐 Streamlit App Features

- 🎛️ Choose your model from a dropdown
- 📝 Enter 8 medical parameters
- 🔎 Real-time prediction (Diabetic / Not Diabetic)
- 📊 Feature importance bar chart
- ✅ Clean UI and user-friendly design
